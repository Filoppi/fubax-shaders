# Fubax FX shaders for ReShade
This repository contains a collection of post-processing ReShade shaders, which I contribute, written in the [ReShade FX shader language](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/blob/slim/REFERENCE.md).

### About ReShade
ReShade is an advanced, fully generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It allows you to add visual effects or adjust the appearance of the image, creating the visual experience you prefer.

To get ReShade, visit [https://reshade.me](https://reshade.me) official website.

## Installation
1. [Download the latest ReShade](https://reshade.me/#download) from the official site.
2. Select the game of choice for installation and the API it uses.
3. During installation, select ***"fubax-shaders by Fubaxiusz"*** along with ***"Standard effects"*** to download this shader-pack and required files.
4. Start your game, open the ReShade in-game menu, and search for the shaders.
5. [Visit the Wiki](https://github.com/Fubaxiusz/fubax-shaders/wiki/Home) to learn how to use my shaders.

### Prerequisites
Fubax-shaders require [Reshade](https://reshade.me) version 5.x or latest, and the *ReShade.fxh*, *ReShadeUI.fxh* files present in the `reshade-shaders\Shaders` folder.

## Usage instruction
Please [visit the Wiki page](https://github.com/Fubaxiusz/fubax-shaders/wiki/Home) to learn how to use various of my shaders (with image explanation), or jump right to:

#### Credits
Besides the shaders created from the ground up by me, a few of them were created as entirely new versions of existing effects, like [Tilt Shift](/Shaders/TiltShift.fx), [Monitor Gamma](/Shaders/MonitorGamma.fx) or [ACES](/Shaders/ACES.fx).
